Here is the repository for myself to learn react.

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook and is used for building user interfaces (UIs) and front-end application.

front--browse



React is often called a framework because of its behavior and capabilities.

mvc--model view controller

framework:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework>

React is the most popular framework in the industry (for now).



Why use it?

1. Makes front-end JavaScript much easier
2. Uses self contained, independent components with their own state
3. much more interactive UIs
4. Virtual DOM
5. JSX-Easily incorporate JS in markup   ï¼ˆwhich is very similar to js)
6. Easy to work with teams



before you learn

JS fundamentals (Objects, Arrays, Conditions, etc)

- Classes 
- Destructuring
- High Order Array Methods - for Each, map , filter
- Arrow Functions
- Fetch API & Promises   



react state

- Components can have state which is an object that determines how that component renders and behaves
- We can also have "application level" state by using a <u>state manager</u> like Redux or Reacts own context API



Start

- CLI Tool for creating React applications
- Uses <u>Webpack</u> but needs no configuration from you
- Comes bundled with a dev server with hot reload
- "<u>npm run build</u>" will compile all your code to something that the browser can read.
